"""
k-means is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve
the well known clustering problem.

The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set
through a certain number of clusters.

- Let  X = {x1,x2,x3,……..,xn} be the set of data points and V = {v1,v2,…….,vc}
  be the set of centers.
- Randomly select ‘c’ cluster centers.
- Calculate the distance between each data point and cluster centers.
- Assign the data point to the cluster center whose distance from
  the cluster center is minimum of all the cluster centers.
- Recalculate the new cluster center using:`v[i] = (1/c[i])Summation(x[i])`
  for no. of data points in ith cluster.
- Recalculate the distance between each data point and new obtained
  cluster centers.
- If no data point was reassigned then stop, otherwise repeat from step 3.


Implementatios of K-mean clustering algorithm is below.
